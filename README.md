### Description

This package provides a simple way to make positionally accurate plots of gene models similar to those found on The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR). These plots are suitable for presentations and publications where showing gene models is appropriate to comunicate genetic research.

### Example

See vignette.

Currently, genemodel is installed with the code:

``` r
devtools::install_bitbucket("greymonroe/genemodel")
library(genemodel)
```
